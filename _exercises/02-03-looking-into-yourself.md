---

We all come into organizations (and relationships of all kinds) with baggage.
What do we keep?
What do we get rid of?

1.  What is an attitude about yourself that you have to let go of?
    [____________________]

2.  What is the benefit for you in keeping this attitude?
    [____________________]

3.  What is the cost to you–and your organization–of keeping this attitude?
    [____________________]

4.  What specific behavior(s) can you practice to change this attitude?
    [____________________]

5.  When, specifically, will I commit myself to practicing this behavior or these behaviors?
    [____________________]

6.  Get someone to hold you accountable.  Who will this be?
    [____________________]

7.  Make a commitment to reviewing your behavior daily:
    each day at [____________________] *(write in the time)*
    I will spend a few minutes reviewing how I am doing at changing this behavior.


## Jorge Aranda

1. I hate asking for help, delegating, or otherwise "bothering" people.

2. This has made me to try to be self-sufficient and independent.

3. I often get stuck on dumb stuff.
   It makes me inefficient.
   It makes it difficult for me to even dare think of forming a group.

4. I can practice asking for help and advice more

5. At the start, I'll be happy if I can think of one weekly instance when I asked for help

6. My partner

7. Each day at the start of my work hours I will spend a few minutes reviewing
   my requests for help and advice,
   as well as my attitude towards them.
