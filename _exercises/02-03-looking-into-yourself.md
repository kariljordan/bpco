We all come into organizations (and relationships of all kinds) with baggage.
What do we keep?
What do we get rid of?

1.  What is an attitude about yourself that you have to let go of?
    [____________________]

2.  What is the benefit for you in keeping this attitude?
    [____________________]

3.  What is the cost to you–and your organization–of keeping this attitude?
    [____________________]

4.  What specific behavior(s) can you practice to change this attitude?
    [____________________]

5.  When, specifically, will I commit myself to practicing this behavior or these behaviors?
    [____________________]

6.  Get someone to hold you accountable.  Who will this be?
    [____________________]

7.  Make a commitment to reviewing your behavior daily:
    each day at [____________________] *(write in the time)*
    I will spend a few minutes reviewing how I am doing at changing this behavior.

## Greg Wilson

1.  I'm never satisfied with anything I make or do.

2.  It pushes me to work harder.

3.  The cost to me is exhaustion and depression:
    I burn out,
    and never being satisfied means never being pleased.
    The cost to the organization is that I ask more of people than I have a right to,
    which can lead to burnout and depression among volunteers.

4.  Not start new projects because "someone needs to do it" when I'm already overloaded;
    judge my work by what's been accomplished, not by what's still undone.

5.  Not starting new projects is an ongoing struggle
    (I now have a list on my browser home page of things I'm *not* going to do).
    Judging my work by what's done rather than undone is ongoing as well.

6.  My spouse.

7.  I will spend two minutes every morning when I first wake up
    making a list of what I accomplished the previous day.
    (I did this for several years at the suggestion of a therapist,
    and found it did help a little.)
