We all come into organizations (and relationships of all kinds) with baggage.
What do we keep?
What do we get rid of?

1.  What is an attitude about yourself that you have to let go of?
    [____________________]

2.  What is the benefit for you in keeping this attitude?
    [____________________]

3.  What is the cost to you–and your organization–of keeping this attitude?
    [____________________]

4.  What specific behavior(s) can you practice to change this attitude?
    [____________________]

5.  When, specifically, will I commit myself to practicing this behavior or these behaviors?
    [____________________]

6.  Get someone to hold you accountable.  Who will this be?
    [____________________]

7.  Make a commitment to reviewing your behavior daily:
    each day at [____________________] *(write in the time)*
    I will spend a few minutes reviewing how I am doing at changing this behavior.

1. I'm quick to dismiss tasks that don't have immediate feedback. These tasks often involve more talking than doing, which I'm not a fan of.

2. I am extremely action-oriented.

3. I recognize some things take time and there are many conversations to be had in order for an action to be performed. I often want to go faster than my colleagues and get to the action as soon as possible, which can sometimes come across as forceful and degrading to their chosen process.

4. I've tried meditating to learn how to be patient. Some days it helps, and some days I truly find it annoying. I think it's a good thing though, and something I have to diligently work towards. 

5. Swapping out morning emails with meditation. 

6. My mom. She cares so much about my wellbeing. 

7. Each morning before I start my day.
