---

We all come into organizations (and relationships of all kinds) with baggage.
What do we keep?
What do we get rid of?

1.  What is an attitude about yourself that you have to let go of?
    [____________________]

2.  What is the benefit for you in keeping this attitude?
    [____________________]

3.  What is the cost to you–and your organization–of keeping this attitude?
    [____________________]

4.  What specific behavior(s) can you practice to change this attitude?
    [____________________]

5.  When, specifically, will I commit myself to practicing this behavior or these behaviors?
    [____________________]

6.  Get someone to hold you accountable.  Who will this be?
    [____________________]

7.  Make a commitment to reviewing your behavior daily:
    each day at [____________________] *(write in the time)*
    I will spend a few minutes reviewing how I am doing at changing this behavior.

1.  If I don't do this, it won't get done correctly.
 
2.  I have control.
 
3.  I become the bottleneck.  We lose the contributions, skills, and buy-in of 
	other members.  The final product is not as good.
 
4.  Delegate to other people, limit the number of things *I* will do.
 
5.  Over the next month, hand off specific tasks: 
	- mentoring committee chair
	- sending discussion emails
	- the leading of the next mentorship committee meeting

6.  Need to confirm with someone.  Will ask my supervisor and/or someone else on 
	the mentorship committee.  

7.  Review behavior at the end of the day.
