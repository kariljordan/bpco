title: "Looking Into Yourself"
---

We all come into organizations (and relationships of all kinds) with baggage.
What do we keep?
What do we get rid of?

1.  What is an attitude about yourself that you have to let go of?
    [____________________]

2.  What is the benefit for you in keeping this attitude?
    [____________________]

3.  What is the cost to you–and your organization–of keeping this attitude?
    [____________________]

4.  What specific behavior(s) can you practice to change this attitude?
    [____________________]

5.  When, specifically, will I commit myself to practicing this behavior or these behaviors?
    [____________________]

6.  Get someone to hold you accountable.  Who will this be?
    [____________________]

7.  Make a commitment to reviewing your behavior daily:
    each day at [____________________] *(write in the time)*
    I will spend a few minutes reviewing how I am doing at changing this behavior.

## Jorge Aranda

1. I hate asking for help, delegating, or otherwise "bothering" people.

2. This has made me to try to be self-sufficient and independent.

3. I often get stuck on dumb stuff.
   It makes me inefficient.
   It makes it difficult for me to even dare think of forming a group.

4. I can practice asking for help and advice more

5. At the start, I'll be happy if I can think of one weekly instance when I asked for help

6. My partner

7. Each day at the start of my work hours I will spend a few minutes reviewing
   my requests for help and advice,
   as well as my attitude towards them.

## Ian Hawke

1. Internal focus: solitary consideration of a problem and its solution without talking it through or checking it against external reality.

2. Easy for an introvert; minimizes conflict and criticism.

3. Too easy not to act on any of my conclusions.

4. Communicate to more people, especially from the people who are or will be affected by the problem and/or the potential solution.

5. Regular social occasions (lunch and coffee breaks) at work. Must expand beyond my usual circle.

6. My partner.

7. On the walk home from work.

## Christina

1.  If I don't do this, it won't get done well (or at all).
 
2.  I have control.
 
3.  I become the bottleneck.  We lose the contributions, skills, and buy-in of 
	other members.  The final product is not as good.
 
4.  Delegate to other people, limit the number of things *I* will do.
 
5.  Over the next month, hand off specific tasks: 
	- mentoring committee chair
	- sending discussion emails
	- the leading of the next mentorship committee meeting

6.  Need to confirm with someone.  Will ask my supervisor and/or someone else on 
	the mentorship committee.  

7.  Review behavior at the end of the day.  

## Greg Wilson

1.  I'm never satisfied with anything I make or do.

2.  It pushes me to work harder.

3.  The cost to me is exhaustion and depression:
    I burn out,
    and never being satisfied means never being pleased.
    The cost to the organization is that I ask more of people than I have a right to,
    which can lead to burnout and depression among volunteers.

4.  Not start new projects because "someone needs to do it" when I'm already overloaded;
    judge my work by what's been accomplished, not by what's still undone.

5.  Not starting new projects is an ongoing struggle
    (I now have a list on my browser home page of things I'm *not* going to do).
    Judging my work by what's done rather than undone is ongoing as well.

6.  My spouse.

7.  I will spend two minutes every morning when I first wake up
    making a list of what I accomplished the previous day.
    (I did this for several years at the suggestion of a therapist,
    and found it did help a little.)

## Kate Hertweck 

1.  What is an attitude about yourself that you have to let go of?
    
    Having everything done perfectly.

2.  What is the benefit for you in keeping this attitude?
    
    Allowing others the capacity to step forward and get work done as well.

3.  What is the cost to you–and your organization–of keeping this attitude?
    
    Sometimes things won't get done on time, or at a level of clarity/accomplishment that I would personally offer.

4.  What specific behavior(s) can you practice to change this attitude?
    
    Delegation of tasks, 

5.  When, specifically, will I commit myself to practicing this behavior or these behaviors?
    
    At meetings (I will not volunteer for a task).

6.  Get someone to hold you accountable.  Who will this be?
    
    The rest of the steering committee. 

7.  Make a commitment to reviewing your behavior daily:
    each day at [____________________] *(write in the time)*
    I will spend a few minutes reviewing how I am doing at changing this behavior.
    
    Each day at lunch (whenever scheduled on my calendar) I will review remaining tasks and determine if someone else would be more appropriate to assign.
