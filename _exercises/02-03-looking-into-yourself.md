title: "Looking Into Yourself"
---

We all come into organizations (and relationships of all kinds) with baggage.
What do we keep?
What do we get rid of?

1.  What is an attitude about yourself that you have to let go of?
    [____________________]
    Thinking that nobody really cares about the things that I care about.

2.  What is the benefit for you in keeping this attitude?
    [____________________]
    Keeps me motivated to work for the cause.

3.  What is the cost to you–and your organization–of keeping this attitude?
    [____________________]
    Missing out on people who want to help but I don't notice that.

4.  What specific behavior(s) can you practice to change this attitude?
    [____________________]
    Listen to what people say and understand the different ways they offer to help.

5.  When, specifically, will I commit myself to practicing this behavior or these behaviors?
    [____________________]
    (I don't really know...)

6.  Get someone to hold you accountable.  Who will this be?
    [____________________]
    A colleague working for the same cause.

7.  Make a commitment to reviewing your behavior daily:
    each day at [____________________] *(write in the time)*
    I will spend a few minutes reviewing how I am doing at changing this behavior.

## Jorge Aranda

1. I hate asking for help, delegating, or otherwise "bothering" people.

2. This has made me to try to be self-sufficient and independent.

3. I often get stuck on dumb stuff.
   It makes me inefficient.
   It makes it difficult for me to even dare think of forming a group.

4. I can practice asking for help and advice more

5. At the start, I'll be happy if I can think of one weekly instance when I asked for help

6. My partner

7. Each day at the start of my work hours I will spend a few minutes reviewing
   my requests for help and advice,
   as well as my attitude towards them.

## Ian Hawke

1. Internal focus: solitary consideration of a problem and its solution without talking it through or checking it against external reality.

2. Easy for an introvert; minimizes conflict and criticism.

3. Too easy not to act on any of my conclusions.

4. Communicate to more people, especially from the people who are or will be affected by the problem and/or the potential solution.

5. Regular social occasions (lunch and coffee breaks) at work. Must expand beyond my usual circle.

6. My partner.

7. On the walk home from work.

## Christina

1.  If I don't do this, it won't get done well (or at all).
 
2.  I have control.
 
3.  I become the bottleneck.  We lose the contributions, skills, and buy-in of 
	other members.  The final product is not as good.
 
4.  Delegate to other people, limit the number of things *I* will do.
 
5.  Over the next month, hand off specific tasks: 
	- mentoring committee chair
	- sending discussion emails
	- the leading of the next mentorship committee meeting

6.  Need to confirm with someone.  Will ask my supervisor and/or someone else on 
	the mentorship committee.  

7.  Review behavior at the end of the day.  

## Greg Wilson

1.  I'm never satisfied with anything I make or do.

2.  It pushes me to work harder.

3.  The cost to me is exhaustion and depression:
    I burn out,
    and never being satisfied means never being pleased.
    The cost to the organization is that I ask more of people than I have a right to,
    which can lead to burnout and depression among volunteers.

4.  Not start new projects because "someone needs to do it" when I'm already overloaded;
    judge my work by what's been accomplished, not by what's still undone.

5.  Not starting new projects is an ongoing struggle
    (I now have a list on my browser home page of things I'm *not* going to do).
    Judging my work by what's done rather than undone is ongoing as well.

6.  My spouse.

7.  I will spend two minutes every morning when I first wake up
    making a list of what I accomplished the previous day.
    (I did this for several years at the suggestion of a therapist,
    and found it did help a little.)

## Kate Hertweck 

1.  What is an attitude about yourself that you have to let go of?
    
    Having everything done perfectly.

2.  What is the benefit for you in keeping this attitude?
    
    Allowing others the capacity to step forward and get work done as well.

3.  What is the cost to you–and your organization–of keeping this attitude?
    
    Sometimes things won't get done on time, or at a level of clarity/accomplishment that I would personally offer.

4.  What specific behavior(s) can you practice to change this attitude?
    
    Delegation of tasks, 

5.  When, specifically, will I commit myself to practicing this behavior or these behaviors?
    
    At meetings (I will not volunteer for a task).

6.  Get someone to hold you accountable.  Who will this be?
    
    The rest of the steering committee. 

7.  Make a commitment to reviewing your behavior daily:
    each day at [____________________] *(write in the time)*
    I will spend a few minutes reviewing how I am doing at changing this behavior.
    
    Each day at lunch (whenever scheduled on my calendar) I will review remaining tasks and determine if someone else would be more appropriate to assign.

## Kat Barrett

1. I'm quick to dismiss tasks that don't have immediate feedback. These tasks often involve more talking than doing, which I'm not a fan of.

2. I am extremely action-oriented.

3. I recognize some things take time and there are many conversations to be had in order for an action to be performed. I often want to go faster than my colleagues and get to the action as soon as possible, which can sometimes come across as forceful and degrading to their chosen process.

4. I've tried meditating to learn how to be patient. Some days it helps, and some days I truly find it annoying. I think it's a good thing though, and something I have to diligently work towards. 

5. Swapping out morning emails with meditation. 

6. My mom. She cares so much about my wellbeing. 

7. Each morning before I start my day.

## Rayna Harris

1. I am not always right.
2. Sometimes I am right or at least partically right, and things move along well when I speak up.
3. Sometimes I am not right, and by speaking loudly too soon I might prevent someone who is right from vocalizing their perspective.
4. Patience.
5. At group meetings, I will raise my hand first with less frequency, maybe evening asking others to speak up before me.
6. I would say Kate or Christina, but both of them are trying to say yes to fewer responsibilities. I will have the part of my brain that wrote the above sentences hold me accountable for now.
7. Each morning, I like to lay in bed and think before I get out of bed. I've been thinking I should use this time for conscious positive thinking. I commit to adding personal reflection and goal setting to my morning before-I-get-out-of-bed routine.

9pm.
