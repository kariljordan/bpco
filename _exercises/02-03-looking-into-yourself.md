title: "Looking Into Yourself"
---

We all come into organizations (and relationships of all kinds) with baggage.
What do we keep?
What do we get rid of?

1.  What is an attitude about yourself that you have to let go of?

    *   **Jorge Aranda:** I hate asking for help, delegating, or otherwise "bothering" people.

    *   **Kat Barrett:** I'm quick to dismiss tasks that don't have immediate feedback. These tasks often involve more talking than doing, which I'm not a fan of.

    *   **Rayna Harris:** I am not always right.

    *   **Ian Hawke:** Internal focus: solitary consideration of a problem and its solution without talking it through or checking it against external reality.

    *   **Kate Hertweck:** Having everything done perfectly.

    *   **Christina Koch:** If I don't do this, it won't get done well (or at all).
 
    *   **Aleksandra Pawlik:** Thinking that nobody really cares about the things that I care about.

    *   **Greg Wilson:** I'm never satisfied with anything I make or do.

2.  What is the benefit for you in keeping this attitude?

    *   **Jorge Aranda:** This has made me to try to be self-sufficient and independent.

    *   **Kat Barrett:** I am extremely action-oriented.

    *   **Rayna Harris:** Sometimes I am right or at least partically right, and things move along well when I speak up.

    *   **Ian Hawke:** Easy for an introvert; minimizes conflict and criticism.

    *   **Kate Hertweck:** Allowing others the capacity to step forward and get work done as well.

    *   **Christina Koch:** I have control.
 
    *   **Aleksandra Pawlik:** Keeps me motivated to work for the cause.

    *   **Greg Wilson:** It pushes me to work harder.

3.  What is the cost to you–and your organization–of keeping this attitude?

    *   **Jorge Aranda:** I often get stuck on dumb stuff.
        It makes me inefficient.
        It makes it difficult for me to even dare think of forming a group.

    *   **Kat Barrett:** I recognize some things take time and there are many conversations to be had in order for an action to be performed. I often want to go faster than my colleagues and get to the action as soon as possible, which can sometimes come across as forceful and degrading to their chosen process.

    *   **Rayna Harris:** Sometimes I am not right, and by speaking loudly too soon I might prevent someone who is right from vocalizing their perspective.

    *   **Ian Hawke:** Too easy not to act on any of my conclusions.

    *   **Kate Hertweck:** Sometimes things won't get done on time, or at a level of clarity/accomplishment that I would personally offer.

    *   **Christina Koch:** I become the bottleneck.  We lose the contributions, skills, and buy-in of 
	other members.  The final product is not as good.

    *   **Aleksandra Pawlik:** Missing out on people who want to help but I don't notice that.

    *   **Greg Wilson:** The cost to me is exhaustion and depression:
        I burn out,
        and never being satisfied means never being pleased.
        The cost to the organization is that I ask more of people than I have a right to,
        which can lead to burnout and depression among volunteers.

4.  What specific behavior(s) can you practice to change this attitude?

    *   **Jorge Aranda:** I can practice asking for help and advice more

    *   **Kat Barrett:** I've tried meditating to learn how to be patient. Some days it helps, and some days I truly find it annoying. I think it's a good thing though, and something I have to diligently work towards. 

    *   **Rayna Harris:** Patience.

    *   **Ian Hawke:** Communicate to more people, especially from the people who are or will be affected by the problem and/or the potential solution.

    *   **Kate Hertweck:** Delegation of tasks, 

    *   **Christina Koch:** Delegate to other people, limit the number of things *I* will do.
 
    *   **Aleksandra Pawlik:** Listen to what people say and understand the different ways they offer to help.

    *   **Greg Wilson:** Not start new projects because "someone needs to do it" when I'm already overloaded;
        judge my work by what's been accomplished, not by what's still undone.

5.  When, specifically, will I commit myself to practicing this behavior or these behaviors?

    *   **Jorge Aranda:** At the start, I'll be happy if I can think of one weekly instance when I asked for help

    *   **Kat Barrett:** Swapping out morning emails with meditation. 

    *   **Rayna Harris:** At group meetings, I will raise my hand first with less frequency, maybe evening asking others to speak up before me.

    *   **Ian Hawke:** Regular social occasions (lunch and coffee breaks) at work. Must expand beyond my usual circle.

    *   **Kate Hertweck:** At meetings (I will not volunteer for a task).

    *   **Christina Koch:** Over the next month, hand off specific tasks: 
	-   mentoring committee chair
	-   sending discussion emails
	-   the leading of the next mentorship committee meeting

    *   **Aleksandra Pawlik:** (I don't really know...)

    *   **Greg Wilson:** Not starting new projects is an ongoing struggle
        (I now have a list on my browser home page of things I'm *not* going to do).
        Judging my work by what's done rather than undone is ongoing as well.

6.  Get someone to hold you accountable.  Who will this be?

    *   **Jorge Aranda:** My partner.

    *   **Kat Barrett:** My mom. She cares so much about my wellbeing. 

    *   **Rayna Harris:** I would say Kate or Christina, but both of them are trying to say yes to fewer responsibilities. I will have the part of my brain that wrote the above sentences hold me accountable for now.

    *   **Ian Hawke:** My partner.

    *   **Kate Hertweck:** The rest of the steering committee. 

    *   **Christina Koch:** Need to confirm with someone.  Will ask my
	supervisor and/or someone else on the mentorship committee.

    *   **Aleksandra Pawlik:** A colleague working for the same cause.

    *   **Greg Wilson:** My spouse.

7.  Make a commitment to reviewing your behavior daily:
    each day at [____________________] *(write in the time)*

    *   **Jorge Aranda:** Each day at the start of my work hours I will spend a few minutes reviewing
        my requests for help and advice,
        as well as my attitude towards them.

    *   **Kat Barrett:** Each morning before I start my day.

    *   **Rayna Harris:** Each morning, I like to lay in bed and think before I get out of bed. I've been thinking I should use this time for conscious positive thinking. I commit to adding personal reflection and goal setting to my morning before-I-get-out-of-bed routine.

    *   **Ian Hawke:** On the walk home from work.

    *   **Kate Hertweck:** I will spend a few minutes reviewing how I am doing at changing this behavior.
        Each day at lunch (whenever scheduled on my calendar) I will review remaining tasks and determine if someone else would be more appropriate to assign.

    *   **Christina Koch:** Review behavior at the end of the day.  

    *   **Aleksandra Pawlik:** I will spend a few minutes reviewing how I am doing at changing this behavior at 9pm.

    *   **Greg Wilson:** I will spend two minutes every morning when I first wake up
        making a list of what I accomplished the previous day.
        (I did this for several years at the suggestion of a therapist,
        and found it did help a little.)
