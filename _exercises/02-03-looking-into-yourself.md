We all come into organizations (and relationships of all kinds) with baggage.
What do we keep?
What do we get rid of?

1.  What is an attitude about yourself that you have to let go of?
    [____________________]
    Thinking that nobody really cares about the things that I care about.

2.  What is the benefit for you in keeping this attitude?
    [____________________]
    Keeps me motivated to work for the cause.

3.  What is the cost to you–and your organization–of keeping this attitude?
    [____________________]
    Missing out on people who want to help but I don't notice that.

4.  What specific behavior(s) can you practice to change this attitude?
    [____________________]
    Listen to what people say and understand the different ways they offer to help.

5.  When, specifically, will I commit myself to practicing this behavior or these behaviors?
    [____________________]
    (I don't really know...)

6.  Get someone to hold you accountable.  Who will this be?
    [____________________]
    A colleague working for the same cause.

7.  Make a commitment to reviewing your behavior daily:
    each day at [____________________] *(write in the time)*
    I will spend a few minutes reviewing how I am doing at changing this behavior.
    9pm.
