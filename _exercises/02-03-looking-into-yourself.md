We all come into organizations (and relationships of all kinds) with baggage.
What do we keep?
What do we get rid of?

1.  What is an attitude about yourself that you have to let go of?
    [____________________]

2.  What is the benefit for you in keeping this attitude?
    [____________________]

3.  What is the cost to you–and your organization–of keeping this attitude?
    [____________________]

4.  What specific behavior(s) can you practice to change this attitude?
    [____________________]

5.  When, specifically, will I commit myself to practicing this behavior or these behaviors?
    [____________________]

6.  Get someone to hold you accountable.  Who will this be?
    [____________________]

7.  Make a commitment to reviewing your behavior daily:
    each day at [____________________] *(write in the time)*
    I will spend a few minutes reviewing how I am doing at changing this behavior.

## Ian Hawke

1. Internal focus: solitary consideration of a problem and its solution without talking it through or checking it against external reality.

2. Easy for an introvert; minimizes conflict and criticism.

3. Too easy not to act on any of my conclusions.

4. Communicate to more people, especially from the people who are or will be affected by the problem and/or the potential solution.

5. Regular social occasions (lunch and coffee breaks) at work. Must expand beyond my usual circle.

6. My partner.

7. On the walk home from work.
