We all come into organizations (and relationships of all kinds) with baggage.
What do we keep?
What do we get rid of?

1.  What is an attitude about yourself that you have to let go of?
    [____________________]

2.  What is the benefit for you in keeping this attitude?
    [____________________]

3.  What is the cost to you–and your organization–of keeping this attitude?
    [____________________]

4.  What specific behavior(s) can you practice to change this attitude?
    [____________________]

5.  When, specifically, will I commit myself to practicing this behavior or these behaviors?
    [____________________]

6.  Get someone to hold you accountable.  Who will this be?
    [____________________]

7.  Make a commitment to reviewing your behavior daily:
    each day at [____________________] *(write in the time)*
    I will spend a few minutes reviewing how I am doing at changing this behavior.


1. I am not always right.
2. Sometimes I am right or at least partically right, and things move along well when I speak up.
3. Sometimes I am not right, and by speaking loudly too soon I might prevent someone who is right from vocalizing their perspective.
4. Patience.
5. At group meetings, I will raise my hand first with less frequency, maybe evening asking others to speak up before me.
6. I would say Kate or Christina, but both of them are trying to say yes to fewer responsibilities. I will have the part of my brain that wrote the above sentences hold me accountable for now.
7. Each morning, I like to lay in bed and think before I get out of bed. I've been thinking I should use this time for conscious positive thinking. I commit to adding personal reflection and goal setting to my morning before-I-get-out-of-bed routine.
