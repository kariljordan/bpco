## Christina

1. You are familiar with Software/Data Carpentry lessons and teaching practices 
	(have read them, attended a workshop, helped or taught at a workshop).  
	Your main goal is not to advance your own interests, but to work for 
	the benefit of the community (acknowledging that these will sometimes overlap). 
	Agreement to support and abide by the SWC/DC Code of Conduct.  

2. Community support; People who can recruit

3. People at all SWC/DC experience + involvement levels (new instructors, local 
	community leaders, staff, steering committee members), from different geographical 
	locations (esp. non-North America), and a diversity of academic institutions (research 
	universities + small schools) 
	and experiences (undergrad, maybe even high school thru late-career).  Representatives 
	of organizations that advocate for underrepresented (race, gender, economic background) 
	groups in science + tech.  

4. Not sure what this question is asking - I'd say anyone who identifies with 
	the labels I've described.  

5. Within SWC/DC as a whole, probably most of them.  On the mentorship committee, no. 

6. Current committee membership is a good start.  I know of others in the organization, 
	not on the committee who could be representatives of these groups.  

7. Organizations representing underrepresented groups (does that sentence even parse?)

8. Belinda, Anelda, Kari, Raniere...

9. Talk to the people above.
