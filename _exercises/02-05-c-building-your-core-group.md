## Jorge Aranda

1. We have the power and the duty to help alleviate suffering.
   We are not saints, and we all try to do good at different degrees according to our personal journeys.

2. Legal help on how to set up gift matching programs. Fundraising. HR help. Outreach. Pretty much everything!

3. Almost everybody in developed nations could help --- not split among racial nor occupational lines, as I see it

4. N/A

5. N/A

6. N/A

7. N/A

8. N/A

9. N/A

## Ian Hawke

1.  All of
    * Ethical thinking about our code and algorithms is essential;
    * Training in this is possible and should cover as many groups as possible;
    * The answers will keep changing, so we must constantly re-evaluate what and how we train, and how we apply the lessons to our own work.

2.  Recruitment, community building.

3.  All research coding groups: in academia from UG up to professoriate, and in industry.

4.  Those will to take part and deliver training will be representative.

5.  No.

6.  Right now I've only thought about academic people, mostly PGs and faculty.

7.  Junior academics, industry.

8.  Don't know yet.

9.  Use contacts, word-of-mouth.

## Christina Koch

1. You are familiar with Software/Data Carpentry lessons and teaching practices 
	(have read them, attended a workshop, helped or taught at a workshop).  
	Your main goal is not to advance your own interests, but to work for 
	the benefit of the community (acknowledging that these will sometimes overlap). 
	Agreement to support and abide by the SWC/DC Code of Conduct.  

2. Community support; People who can recruit

3. People at all SWC/DC experience + involvement levels (new instructors, local 
	community leaders, staff, steering committee members), from different geographical 
	locations (esp. non-North America), and a diversity of academic institutions (research 
	universities + small schools) 
	and experiences (undergrad, maybe even high school thru late-career).  Representatives 
	of organizations that advocate for underrepresented (race, gender, economic background) 
	groups in science + tech.  

4. Not sure what this question is asking - I'd say anyone who identifies with 
	the labels I've described.  

5. Within SWC/DC as a whole, probably most of them.  On the mentorship committee, no. 

6. Current committee membership is a good start.  I know of others in the organization, 
	not on the committee who could be representatives of these groups.  

7. Organizations representing underrepresented groups (does that sentence even parse?)

8. Belinda, Anelda, Kari, Raniere...

9. Talk to the people above. 

## Greg Wilson

1.  The essential principle is belief that tech should be truly open to all,
    not just in the negative sense ("there's no rule that says you can't take part")
    but in the positive sense ("it's truly accessible and welcoming to everyone").

2.  The organization needs fundraising and recruitment.

3.  We want groups like Black Girls Code,
    SACNAS,
    and the apprenticeship program at Pinterest to take part.

4.  The founders/leaders of these groups are their representatives.

5.  We do not have people from all of these groups in our organization yet.

6.  The people we *do* have are a handful of those who helped organize the 2015 meeting
    (see <http://t3summit.org>).

7.  We are missing representatives from dozens of other groups.

8.  As above,
    we hope their founders/leaders will represent them.
    We also hope to involve some of the participants in those groups,
    i.e.,
    we would like to have both someone who organized PyLadies
    and someone who was helped by PyLadies.

9.  This is going to have to be word of mouth and personal contact:
    there isn't an organization yet that binds groups like this together
    (or if there is, we haven't found it).
    The [ACM Richard Tapia Celebration of Diversity in Computing](http://tapiaconference.org/)
    is a likely starting point as well.
    
## Kate Hertweck

1.  What are the organization's essential principles?
    (What are the deal-breaker agreements you require for any member of the core group?)
    
    Commitment to open availability of materials, Code of Conduct, model of teaching (and appropriate lessons)

2.  What skills does the organization need?
    *   Accounting (?)
    *   Legal help (?)
    *   Community support
    *   Special knowledge of higher-level sysadmin/git/etc than we teach

3.  What are the groups or communities (old people, young people, tenants, home owners,
    Blacks, Italians, Catholics, Latinos, business people, labor unions, etc.) you
    eventually want in your organization? 
    
Underrepresented groups in science and other academic disciplines, international members, all levels of education from post-secondary on up to professionals.

4.  Who is representative of these groups?
    
    Undergrads, grad students, postdocs, faculty, research associates, administrators, librarians, etc from around the world

5.  Do you have someone from all of these core groups in your organization?
    *   Yes-ish

6.  Who are they? 

Steering Committee is fairly representative, instructors are fairly well dispersed (provided they stay connected)

7.  Who is missing? 

Less interaction in leadership from international groups than seems appropriate

8.  Who might represent these missing groups? 

Regional leaders from those areas?

9.  If you don't know, how can you find someone who might?
    
Ask instructors of workshops in those places.

(My apologies, I feel like I was really starting to lose focus in these last few sections)
