1.  What are the organization's essential principles?
    (What are the deal-breaker agreements you require for any member of the core group?)
    
    Commitment to open availability of materials, Code of Conduct, model of teaching (and appropriate lessons)

2.  What skills does the organization need?
    *   Accounting (?)
    *   Legal help (?)
    *   Community support
    *   Special knowledge of higher-level sysadmin/git/etc than we teach

3.  What are the groups or communities (old people, young people, tenants, home owners,
    Blacks, Italians, Catholics, Latinos, business people, labor unions, etc.) you
    eventually want in your organization? 
    
Underrepresented groups in science and other academic disciplines, international members, all levels of education from post-secondary on up to professionals.

4.  Who is representative of these groups?
    
    Undergrads, grad students, postdocs, faculty, research associates, administrators, librarians, etc from around the world

5.  Do you have someone from all of these core groups in your organization?
    *   Yes-ish

6.  Who are they? 

Steering Committee is fairly representative, instructors are fairly well dispersed (provided they stay connected)

7.  Who is missing? 

Less interaction in leadership from international groups than seems appropriate

8.  Who might represent these missing groups? 

Regional leaders from those areas?

9.  If you don't know, how can you find someone who might?
    
Ask instructors of workshops in those places.

(My apologies, I feel like I was really starting to lose focus in these last few sections)
