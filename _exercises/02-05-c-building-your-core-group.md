1.  All of
    * Ethical thinking about our code and algorithms is essential;
    * Training in this is possible and should cover as many groups as possible;
    * The answers will keep changing, so we must constantly re-evaluate what and how we train, and how we apply the lessons to our own work.

2.  Recruitment, community building.

3.  All research coding groups: in academia from UG up to professoriate, and in industry.

4.  Those will to take part and deliver training will be representative.

5.  No.

6.  Right now I've only thought about academic people, mostly PGs and faculty.

7.  Junior academics, industry.

8.  Don't know yet.

9.  Use contacts, word-of-mouth.

## Greg Wilson

1.  The essential principle is belief that tech should be truly open to all,
    not just in the negative sense ("there's no rule that says you can't take part")
    but in the positive sense ("it's truly accessible and welcoming to everyone").

2.  The organization needs fundraising and recruitment.

3.  We want groups like Black Girls Code,
    SACNAS,
    and the apprenticeship program at Pinterest to take part.

4.  The founders/leaders of these groups are their representatives.

5.  We do not have people from all of these groups in our organization yet.

6.  The people we *do* have are a handful of those who helped organize the 2015 meeting
    (see <http://t3summit.org>).

7.  We are missing representatives from dozens of other groups.

8.  As above,
    we hope their founders/leaders will represent them.
    We also hope to involve some of the participants in those groups,
    i.e.,
    we would like to have both someone who organized PyLadies
    and someone who was helped by PyLadies.

9.  This is going to have to be word of mouth and personal contact:
    there isn't an organization yet that binds groups like this together
    (or if there is, we haven't found it).
    The [ACM Richard Tapia Celebration of Diversity in Computing](http://tapiaconference.org/)
    is a likely starting point as well.
