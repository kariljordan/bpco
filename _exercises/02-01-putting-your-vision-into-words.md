## Jorge Aranda

I see a group of people in the developed world who,
aware of their privilege and relative wealth,
of the great amount of preventable suffering worldwide,
and of their power to alleviate said suffering,
engage with local companies, governments, and individuals
to establish programs, and commitments that will funnel resources
into charities that work on these causes effectively.

## Ian Hawke

I see a group that helps people to work out whether they *should* do something with code as well as whether they *could*: to think about the societal consequences of building and using a research code.

## Katy Huff

I have two because I'm indecisive.

- I see a group of nuclear collaborators (graduate advisees, peer professors, 
  laboratory scientists) that advance nuclear engineering sustainability.
- I see a self-sustaining proliferation of hyper-local communities of peer 
  learning who effectively share skills for best practices in scientific 
  computing. 

## Christina Koch

I see a a Software/Data Carpentry mentoring ecosystem where individuals 
are invited into communities where they can give and receive knowledge on 
a spectrum of topics that contribute to their growth as instructors, 
researchers, and community leaders.  

# Kari L. Jordan

I see a school system that teaches team building, problem solving,
critical thinking, and the fundamental skills needed to pursue careers
in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.

## Greg Wilson

I see a loosely-knit group of people who care about getting people from under-represented communities into tech,
who are organizing grassroots groups and/or working on innovative recruiting projects in companies,
and who talk regularly online and meet once a year in person to exchange ideas and support one another.
