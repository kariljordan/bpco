title: "Finding the Stories That Guide You"
---

This exercise is one way to start to learn and tell your story.

1.  What is something you feel passionately about?
    What bothers you so much that you think someone should do something about it?
    Change that to: "I should do something about that!"

2.  Why does this subject matter to you?

3.  Write down a story from your life that relates to your answers to Questions 1 and 2.
    Don't worry if it does not seem clear to you why you chose this particular story.
    It does not have to be the most important thing in your life.
    Just start with something you care about.
    (Use a separate sheet of paper.)

    Think about why you chose this story.

## Jorge Aranda

1. I feel passionately that the Western lifestyle is obscenely wasteful,
   and that such waste is unethical when one considers global inequality
   and the fact that one could save lives, or dramatically enhance them,
   with even small sacrifices or compromises.

2. This matters to me because I've seen extreme inequality first hand,
   I know it is unjust,
   I know I can help fix it,
   and I want to do so.

3. Once, running late for a meeting, my mentor and I caught a cab.
   I mentioned that it was silly to do so just to travel six or eight blocks,
   and he asked---a bit derisively, I thought, but also with curiousity---
   if it was wrong to spend on a cab because elsewhere people have nothing to eat.
   I said of course not; they are there and we are here,
   I can't really impact their lives, and without a cab we'd be late.
   But I've come back to this exchange many times since
   (especially when I notice I'm being wasteful again)
   and through research and reflection I've learned that my answer was wrong:
   I could have affected a stranger's life hugely with a Toronto cab fare,
   and I've forgotten who we met that one time or what we discussed,
   but I know it definitely was not as important.
   This does not mean, at all, that I don't enjoy small or large luxuries anymore
   (I wish it did; I'm not that good),
   just that I try to err on the other side a bit more.

4. This story is one of several personal instances I have of Peter Singer's
   classic "drowning child" thought experiment,
   and when I first read about it things immediately clicked,
   and I realized I (we) do have an active role to play in this.
