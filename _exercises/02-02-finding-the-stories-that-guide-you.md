title: "Finding the Stories That Guide You"
---

This exercise is one way to start to learn and tell your story.

1.  What is something you feel passionately about?
    What bothers you so much that you think someone should do something about it?
    Change that to: "I should do something about that!"

2.  Why does this subject matter to you?

3.  Write down a story from your life that relates to your answers to Questions 1 and 2.
    Don't worry if it does not seem clear to you why you chose this particular story.
    It does not have to be the most important thing in your life.
    Just start with something you care about.
    (Use a separate sheet of paper.)

4.  What does this story mean to you?
    Think about why you chose this story.

## Christina

1. I feel passionately about removing barriers (primarily fear) from things 
 I care about (belonging to communities, technology, mathematics).
  Someone should do something about instructors/peers/community members who 
  dismiss, belittle or obfuscate people who are trying to learn new things 
  or participate in new ventures.  
  
2. I love these things! (tech, community, math)  It's sad to me that 
	they're not available to people because of fear, discrimination, or lack 
	of opportunity.  

3. The year after college, I worked in Washington, DC and lived in a community 
    house with 6 other women.  We had some similarities (all college-educated, mostly 
    attended liberal-arts-like schools) but were also very different in temperment, 
    personality, interests, activity level, neatness, etc.  We clicked as a 
    house because we were all really committed to making it work and had some challenging 
    conversations (and made some concessions).  One time I really saw our community in 
    action is when one of my housemates was unexpectedly hospitalized.  We all went to visit her in 
    shifts, even though it took an hour to get there on the bus or by bike.  And we 
    didn't even really talk about whether we were going to do it or not - we just 
    divided up the times and did it.  
    
4. Between that community experience and the people I worked with on a regular 
    basis, I left DC with the strong feeling that all these people were "my people," 
    not in a possessive or parental way, but in the sense that their lives mattered 
    to me and my life mattered to them.  We were all equal in what we had to give.
