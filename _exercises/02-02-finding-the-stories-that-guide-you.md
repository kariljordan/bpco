This exercise is one way to start to learn and tell your story.

1.  What is something you feel passionately about?
    What bothers you so much that you think someone should do something about it?
    Change that to: "I should do something about that!"

    Education system in which students who have better access to resources due to their background and who grow up in stable family environment have better changes to achieve more than students who do not have that. It is unfair but it is rarely being recognised by teachers and others involved in education.

2.  Why does this subject matter to you?

    [____________________]
    Because of my personal experiences. Because it can help others improve their lives.

3.  Write down a story from your life that relates to your answers to Questions 1 and 2.
    Don't worry if it does not seem clear to you why you chose this particular story.
    It does not have to be the most important thing in your life.
    Just start with something you care about.
    (Use a separate sheet of paper.)

    I thought I was too stupid to be a software developer because I didn't realize that the "programming superstars" I studied with had been learning and experimenting with software development for at least few years.

4.  What does this story mean to you?
    Think about why you chose this story.
