This exercise is one way to start to learn and tell your story.

1.  What is something you feel passionately about?
    What bothers you so much that you think someone should do something about it?
    Change that to: "I should do something about that!"

2.  Why does this subject matter to you?

3.  Write down a story from your life that relates to your answers to Questions 1 and 2.
    Don't worry if it does not seem clear to you why you chose this particular story.
    It does not have to be the most important thing in your life.
    Just start with something you care about.
    (Use a separate sheet of paper.)

    Think about why you chose this story.

## Greg Wilson

1.  I feel passionately that computing (and tech in general) should be accessible and welcoming to everyone.

2.  This matters to me because I've become increasingly uncomfortable as I've grown older
    with all of the subtle and not-so-subtle ways that some people are given fewer opportunities than others
    and made to feel less welcome.

3.  When I first went to university,
    and later when I went to grad school,
    I discovered that coming from the "right" place and knowing the "right" people
    mattered more than being smart, working hard, or even being a decent person.
    It wasn't until I was in my thirties that I began wondering (uncomfortably)
    about what it would be like if that was amplified ten-fold and ever-present
    because of my color or orientation.

4.  I think part of us is forever the little kid we once were,
    and more and more I hear my little kid saying, "But that's not fair!"
