title: "Finding the Stories That Guide You"
---

This exercise is one way to start to learn and tell your story.

1.  What is something you feel passionately about?
    What bothers you so much that you think someone should do something about it?
    Change that to: "I should do something about that!"

2.  Why does this subject matter to you?

3.  Write down a story from your life that relates to your answers to Questions 1 and 2.
    Don't worry if it does not seem clear to you why you chose this particular story.
    It does not have to be the most important thing in your life.
    Just start with something you care about.
    (Use a separate sheet of paper.)

4.  What does this story mean to you?
    Think about why you chose this story.

## Ian Hawke

1. I believe that scientific research, particularly research codes, should be used "for good". I should make it easier, and a higher priority, for people to think about the consequences of their work.

2. I am growing ever more convinced that the short term and narrow focus of much current research I see, combined with "impact" agendas, will do harm both to individuals and society.

3. When struggling with my university teaching training course (10 years ago now) I had a meeting with the course convenor. They commented that "it must be very difficult for the mathematical and hard science people such as yourself to work on essay, language based material such as this.". My response was roughly: "No, that's easy. You've given us a model of teaching: fiddling with and optimizing models is what we do for a living!".

4. When my (or other researcher's) focus is narrow, looking to game the system and move on, I forget that teaching isn't about models or optimization, but about *people*. The same is too easily true of code: if the code matters, then it matters because it will change (in however small an amount) people's lives.
