title: "Finding the Stories That Guide You"

This exercise is one way to start to learn and tell your story.

1.  What is something you feel passionately about?
    What bothers you so much that you think someone should do something about it?
    Change that to: "I should do something about that!"

2.  Why does this subject matter to you?

3.  Write down a story from your life that relates to your answers to Questions 1 and 2.
    Don't worry if it does not seem clear to you why you chose this particular story.
    It does not have to be the most important thing in your life.
    Just start with something you care about.
    (Use a separate sheet of paper.)

1.  What is something you feel passionately about?
    What bothers you so much that you think someone should do something about it?
    Change that to: "I should do something about that!"

    I am passionate about fairness, accessibility, and inclusivity in education.

2.  Why does this subject matter to you?

    I believe I am ethically and morally bound as an educator (and as leader of an educational organization) to support these values in educational spaces, and that it makes science (and all fields of study) better in the process.

3.  Write down a story from your life that relates to your answers to Questions 1 and 2.
    Don't worry if it does not seem clear to you why you chose this particular story.
    It does not have to be the most important thing in your life.

    I believe education is a conversation between instructor and learner, and have spent time teaching semester-long classes (in bioinformatics) to learn about particular challenges my students face. On one occassion, I talked with a handful of students before class started about their educational backgrounds. Their challenges were staggering: one student was homeschooled as an adolescent because, as an immigrant from the UK, her accent was mocked by her peers. Another student struggled with a Latin heritage (and name), but criticism from her peers because she was "too white." Another had moved to our region from out of state and couldn't quite grasp the unspoken nuances of how the culture worked. I had a student (graduating senior!) who was verbally appreciative that an instructor would ask and remember his preferred name. Some of my students have no idea of a career path and are desperate for marketable skills. All of these issues are related to how they perceive my class materials and are motivated to learn them (or even if they think it's really possible). I see my role as an educator and leader as recognizing the diversity of students with which we interact, and finding ways to best serve them (or even get them into our classrooms to begin with!).

4.  What does this story mean to you?
    Think about why you chose this story.

    I am frustrated by invisible barriers to student success and classism associated with education (especially higher-ed). I am frustrated by instructors who are only capable of teaching students that are like them. I am frustrated by the lip service paid to serving underrepresented groups without any effort to understanding what it is they need and how to accomplish these tasks, and by these efforts constantly taking a back seat to self-service. I want to do better.
