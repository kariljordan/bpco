title: "Finding the Stories That Guide You"
---

This exercise is one way to start to learn and tell your story.

1.  What is something you feel passionately about?
    What bothers you so much that you think someone should do something about it?
    Change that to: "I should do something about that!"

2.  Why does this subject matter to you?

3.  Write down a story from your life that relates to your answers to Questions 1 and 2.
    Don't worry if it does not seem clear to you why you chose this particular story.
    It does not have to be the most important thing in your life.
    Just start with something you care about.
    (Use a separate sheet of paper.)

    Think about why you chose this story.

## Rayna Harris

1. Currently, I'm a little fed up with demotivating learning enviornments. I'm tired of hearing things like "scare them on the first day" and "your way of doing things is inferior to mine because I said so". 
2. This matters to me because it turns people away from learning and creates unnecessary resentment.
3. I've heard statments these and similar statments for years, and I think its really unnecessary. I look forward to a day when there are no bullies at the front of the classroom. 
4. The thing I worry about is that I do can have strong opinions about how things should be done, and I would like to not turn into the professors I despise.
