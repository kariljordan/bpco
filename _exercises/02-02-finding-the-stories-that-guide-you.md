title: "Finding the Stories That Guide You"
---

This exercise is one way to start to learn and tell your story.

1.  What is something you feel passionately about?
    What bothers you so much that you think someone should do something about it?
    Change that to: "I should do something about that!"

2.  Why does this subject matter to you?

3.  Write down a story from your life that relates to your answers to Questions 1 and 2.
    Don't worry if it does not seem clear to you why you chose this particular story.
    It does not have to be the most important thing in your life.
    Just start with something you care about.
    (Use a separate sheet of paper.)

4.  What does this story mean to you?
    Think about why you chose this story.

## Ian Hawke

1. I believe that scientific research, particularly research codes, should be used "for good". I should make it easier, and a higher priority, for people to think about the consequences of their work.

2. I am growing ever more convinced that the short term and narrow focus of much current research I see, combined with "impact" agendas, will do harm both to individuals and society.

3. When struggling with my university teaching training course (10 years ago now) I had a meeting with the course convenor. They commented that "it must be very difficult for the mathematical and hard science people such as yourself to work on essay, language based material such as this.". My response was roughly: "No, that's easy. You've given us a model of teaching: fiddling with and optimizing models is what we do for a living!".

4. When my (or other researcher's) focus is narrow, looking to game the system and move on, I forget that teaching isn't about models or optimization, but about *people*. The same is too easily true of code: if the code matters, then it matters because it will change (in however small an amount) people's lives.

## Christina Koch

1. I feel passionately about removing barriers (primarily fear) from things 
 I care about (belonging to communities, technology, mathematics).
  Someone should do something about instructors/peers/community members who 
  dismiss, belittle or obfuscate people who are trying to learn new things 
  or participate in new ventures.  
  
2. I love these things! (tech, community, math)  It's sad to me that 
	they're not available to people because of fear, discrimination, or lack 
	of opportunity.  

3. The year after college, I worked in Washington, DC and lived in a community 
    house with 6 other women.  We had some similarities (all college-educated, mostly 
    attended liberal-arts-like schools) but were also very different in temperment, 
    personality, interests, activity level, neatness, etc.  We clicked as a 
    house because we were all really committed to making it work and had some challenging 
    conversations (and made some concessions).  One time I really saw our community in 
    action is when one of my housemates was unexpectedly hospitalized.  We all went to visit her in 
    shifts, even though it took an hour to get there on the bus or by bike.  And we 
    didn't even really talk about whether we were going to do it or not - we just 
    divided up the times and did it.  
    
4. Between that community experience and the people I worked with on a regular 
    basis, I left DC with the strong feeling that all these people were "my people," 
    not in a possessive or parental way, but in the sense that their lives mattered 
    to me and my life mattered to them.  We were all equal in what we had to give. 

## Greg Wilson

1.  I feel passionately that computing (and tech in general) should be accessible and welcoming to everyone.

2.  This matters to me because I've become increasingly uncomfortable as I've grown older
    with all of the subtle and not-so-subtle ways that some people are given fewer opportunities than others
    and made to feel less welcome.

3.  When I first went to university,
    and later when I went to grad school,
    I discovered that coming from the "right" place and knowing the "right" people
    mattered more than being smart, working hard, or even being a decent person.
    It wasn't until I was in my thirties that I began wondering (uncomfortably)
    about what it would be like if that was amplified ten-fold and ever-present
    because of my color or orientation.

4.  I think part of us is forever the little kid we once were,
    and more and more I hear my little kid saying, "But that's not fair!"
