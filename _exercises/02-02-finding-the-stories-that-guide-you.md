title: "Finding the Stories That Guide You"
---

This exercise is one way to start to learn and tell your story.

1.  What is something you feel passionately about?
    What bothers you so much that you think someone should do something about it?
    Change that to: "I should do something about that!"

2.  Why does this subject matter to you?

3.  Write down a story from your life that relates to your answers to Questions 1 and 2.
    Don't worry if it does not seem clear to you why you chose this particular story.
    It does not have to be the most important thing in your life.
    Just start with something you care about.
    (Use a separate sheet of paper.)

1. I am passionate about finding communities that are engaged, thoughtful and welcoming, and making sure others (particularly women) can find them as well. I wish there was a better way to filter out noise - my news feed is flooded with business plans and groups. It'd be great if there was a more genuine/honest/transparent way of going about discovering groups. Kinda like online dating???

2. I finally found a community I feel safe and accepted in - but it took a long time (10+ years in fact) to find it. 

3. Three years ago, I realized that I helped create an ecosystem that I, myself, did not feel welcome in. I was working alongside organizers who looked liked me and spoke like me, but I didn't feel as if I could truly be myself around them. Years went by before I took a step back and critically looked at what I was contributing to and fully understood why I often had pain of anxiety and discomfort whenever I was working. It was a weird discovery, but it forced me to pay attention to feelings (emotional and physical) a lot more. It also made me realize that there were probably other members in that ecosystem who felt the same way.

4. I wanted to learn more about what makes environemts truly "inclusive" and understand the framework around them. Working with the right group of people involves so many feelings. Everyone is different on so many levels, but all deserve to be their truest form of self.
