title: "Finding Your Core Beliefs"
---

1.  What are some of the core beliefs I hold that apply to this group?

    *   **Jorge Aranda:** I believe that we can help alleviate suffering even through minor adjustments to our lifestyles

    *   **Kat Barrett:** Being your true self. Whether that means your capabilities, values, strengths, weaknesses, etc.

    *   **Rayna Harris:** I belive that there are too many exercises in this chapter, and that
        the GitHub way of collecting responses is technically challenging and
        cumbersome (except Kate somehow found a way to do it beautifully). I
        worry that by expressing my frustration,I might detract from anyone
        else's enthusiasm and joy for completing all of these exercise.

        One a more serious notes, none of the belief's written in the book or
        by the members of this group speak to me... I'm not sure what I belive
        in that would have an impact on the organizations in question...

    *   **Ian Hawke:** Algorithms are powerful, and their use will only increase in the future.

    *   **Kate Hertweck:** Inclusivity (Code of Conduct, or CoC), shared (community-involved) governance, service to underrepresented groups

    *   **Christina Koch:** People want to be involved and connect with each other.  
	Everyone should be able to participate; the only condition for participation is 
	respect for others and willingness to listen.  

    *   **Aleksandra Pawlik:** Most, if not all, skills and knowledge can be developed. It is not a "gift" or "talent".

    *   **Greg Wilson:** I believe in fairness,
        and that "fair" includes what happens *before* you get on the racetrack
        as well as what happens once the race starts.

2.  Where did I learn these beliefs?

    *   **Jorge Aranda:** Fairly recently, through research

    *   **Kat Barrett:** Working with women who were afraid to be their true selves, especially when working with men. 

    *   **Ian Hawke:** Mathematical training and scientific PR.

    *   **Kate Hertweck:** Personal experience, professional service

    *   **Christina Koch:** My own experience, watching others, learning about the need for community 
	rules and expectations. 
	
    *   **Aleksandra Pawlik:** Software and Data Carpentry

    *   **Greg Wilson:** As a child.

3.  Have I tested or reflected on the accuracy of these beliefs?

    *   **Jorge Aranda:** Yes, I have reflected on them

    *   **Ian Hawke:** Yes (although the future is hard to predict, let alone test).

    *   **Kate Hertweck:** Yes

    *   **Christina Koch:** Sort of - they were born out of observation and experience.  

    *   **Aleksandra Pawlik:** Yes

    *   **Greg Wilson:** Yes, I've tested this belief.

4.  Can I test these beliefs now?

    *   **Jorge Aranda:** Yes, these beliefs can be tested

    *   **Ian Hawke:** Yes.

    *   **Kate Hertweck:** Yes

    *   **Christina Koch:** Yes

    *   **Aleksandra Pawlik:** Yes

    *   **Greg Wilson:** Yes, I can test them now.

5.  How can I test them?

    *   **Jorge Aranda:** Through analysis of the soundness of effectiveness studies conducted by evaluators such as GiveWell

    *   **Ian Hawke:** Historical data on the use and spread of algorithms and computation in society.

    *   **Kate Hertweck:** Evaluate instances in which CoC was violated,
        assess other organizations with different governance
        structures, quantify service to underrepresented groups

    *   **Christina Koch:** Not sure...trying things out? Talk to other community leaders?

    *   **Aleksandra Pawlik:** Discussions with people who believe otherwise (?)

    *   **Greg Wilson:** By looking at stats on the racial and gender imbalances in tech
        and on educational spending per capita for various social groups.

6.  Am I willing to do that?  (Or do I want to hold on to these beliefs no matter what?)

    *   **Jorge Aranda:** Yes, and I have done so

    *   **Ian Hawke:** Yes, although not to the depth that I would consider it a "proof".

    *   **Kate Hertweck:** Yes: Given this is an organization already operating, continual
        assessment is necessary.

    *   **Christina Koch:** My ultimate goal is to create a supportive community (see 7.) so if I could 
	be shown that these beliefs do *not* help achieve that goal, I would be 
	willing to consider alternatives.  However, given that these beliefs are 
	intrinsic to what a supportive community is (in my mind), it would be a tough sell!  

    *   **Aleksandra Pawlik:** Yes

    *   **Greg Wilson:** Yes, I'm willing to do that.
        (The world comes up short when I do...)

7.  How will these beliefs affect the group?

    *   **Jorge Aranda:** They give the group a sense of purpose

    *   **Ian Hawke:** If we believe "with great power comes great
        responsibility", then increasing algorithmic power means we
        must take more responsibility for the algorithms and their
        potential consequences.

    *   **Kate Hertweck:** Hopefully motivate and increase participation, may challenge financial model

    *   **Christina Koch:** These beliefs will help the group be welcoming.  

    *   **Aleksandra Pawlik:** I will always ask for *evidence* when challenging these beliefs.

    *   **Greg Wilson:** This belief is what motivates participation in this group.
        (Participants may put a veneer of self-interest on that belief,
        e.g., say that they want to increase diversity in computing
        in order to have a larger pool of talent to hire from,
        but in my experience that's just rationalization:
        people who actually *do* something about tech's imbalances
        are always really motivated by principle.)

8.  Do other members of the group also share these beliefs?

    *   **Jorge Aranda:** Yes. It would be hard for other members to join the group without sharing this belief.

    *   **Ian Hawke:** I would expect others in the group to hold this belief.

    *   **Kate Hertweck:** *   Maybe?

    *   **Christina Koch:** I think they should; as far as I know, they do. 

    *   **Aleksandra Pawlik:** Yes (or at least I hope so)

    *   **Greg Wilson:** Yes,
        I expect other participants in this group will share this belief.
