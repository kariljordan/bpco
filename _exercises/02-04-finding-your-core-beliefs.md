## Christina

1. People want to be involved and connect with each other.  
	Everyone should be able to participate; the only condition for participation is 
	respect for others and willingness to listen.  
	
2. My own experience, watching others, learning about the need for community 
	rules and expectations. 
	
3. Sort of - they were born out of observation and experience.  

4. Yes

5. Not sure...trying things out? Talk to other community leaders?

6. My ultimate goal is to create a supportive community (see 7.) so if I could 
	be shown that these beliefs do *not* help achieve that goal, I would be 
	willing to consider alternatives.  It would be a hard sell!  

7. These beliefs will help the group be welcoming.  

8. I think they should; as far as I know, they do.
