## Jorge Aranda

1. I believe that we can help alleviate suffering even through minor adjustments to our lifestyles

2. Fairly recently, through research

3. Yes, I have reflected on them

4. Yes, these beliefs can be tested

5. Through analysis of the soundness of effectiveness studies conducted by evaluators such as GiveWell

6. Yes, and I have done so

7. They give the group a sense of purpose

8. Yes. It would be hard for other members to join the group without sharing this belief.

## Ian Hawke

1. Algorithms are powerful, and their use will only increase in the future.

2. Mathematical training and scientific PR.

3. Yes (although the future is hard to predict, let alone test).

4. Yes.

5. Historical data on the use and spread of algorithms and computation in society.

6. Yes, although not to the depth that I would consider it a "proof".

7. If we believe "with great power comes great responsibility", then increasing algorithmic power means we must take more responsibility for the algorithms and their potential consequences.

8. I would expect others in the group to hold this belief.

## Christina Koch

1. People want to be involved and connect with each other.  
	Everyone should be able to participate; the only condition for participation is 
	respect for others and willingness to listen.  
	
2. My own experience, watching others, learning about the need for community 
	rules and expectations. 
	
3. Sort of - they were born out of observation and experience.  

4. Yes

5. Not sure...trying things out? Talk to other community leaders?

6. My ultimate goal is to create a supportive community (see 7.) so if I could 
	be shown that these beliefs do *not* help achieve that goal, I would be 
	willing to consider alternatives.  However, given that these beliefs are 
	intrinsic to what a supportive community is (in my mind), it would be a tough sell!  

7. These beliefs will help the group be welcoming.  

8. I think they should; as far as I know, they do. 

## Greg Wilson

1.  I believe in fairness,
    and that "fair" includes what happens *before* you get on the racetrack
    as well as what happens once the race starts.

2.  As a child.

3.  Yes, I've tested this belief.

4.  Yes, I can test them now.

5.  By looking at stats on the racial and gender imbalances in tech
    and on educational spending per capita for various social groups.

6.  Yes, I'm willing to do that.
    (The world comes up short when I do...)

7.  This belief is what motivates participation in this group.
    (Participants may put a veneer of self-interest on that belief,
    e.g., say that they want to increase diversity in computing
    in order to have a larger pool of talent to hire from,
    but in my experience that's just rationalization:
    people who actually *do* something about tech's imbalances
    are always really motivated by principle.)

8.  Yes,
    I expect other participants in this group will share this belief.

## Kate Hertweck


1.  What are some of the core beliefs I hold that apply to this group?
    
    Inclusivity (Code of Conduct, or CoC), shared (community-involved) governance, service to underrepresented groups

2.  Where did I learn these beliefs?
    
    Personal experience, professional service

3.  Have I tested or reflected on the accuracy of these beliefs?
    *   Yes

4.  Can I test these beliefs now?
    *   Yes

5.  How can I test them?
    
    Evaluate instances in which CoC was violated, assess other organizations with different governance structures, quantify service to underrepresented groups

6.  Am I willing to do that?  (Or do I want to hold on to these beliefs no matter what?)
    *   Yes

Comments: Given this is an organization already operating, continual assessment is necessary.

7.  How will these beliefs affect the group?
    
    Hopefully motivate and increase participation, may challenge financial model

8.  Do other members of the group also share these beliefs?
    *   Maybe?
