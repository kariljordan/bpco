## Ian Hawke

1. Algorithms are powerful, and their use will only increase in the future.

2. Mathematical training and scientific PR.

3. Yes (although the future is hard to predict, let alone test).

4. Yes.

5. Historical data on the use and spread of algorithms and computation in society.

6. Yes, although not to the depth that I would consider it a "proof".

7. If we believe "with great power comes great responsibility", then increasing algorithmic power means we must take more responsibility for the algorithms and their potential consequences.

8. I would expect others in the group to hold this belief.
