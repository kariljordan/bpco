## Rayna Harris
I belive that there are too many exercises in this chapter, and that the GitHub way of collecting responses is technically challenging and cumbersome (except Kate somehow found a way to do it beautifully). I worry that by expressing my frustration,I might detract from anyone else's enthusiasm and joy for completing all of these exercise. 

One a more serious notes, none of the belief's written in the book or by the members of this group speak to me... I'm not sure what I belive in that would have an impact on the organizations in question...
