## Ian Hawke

1. Algorithms are powerful, and their use will only increase in the future.

2. Mathematical training and scientific PR.

3. Yes (although the future is hard to predict, let alone test).

4. Yes.

5. Historical data on the use and spread of algorithms and computation in society.

6. Yes, although not to the depth that I would consider it a "proof".

7. If we believe "with great power comes great responsibility", then increasing algorithmic power means we must take more responsibility for the algorithms and their potential consequences.

8. I would expect others in the group to hold this belief.

## Greg Wilson

1.  I believe in fairness,
    and that "fair" includes what happens *before* you get on the racetrack
    as well as what happens once the race starts.

2.  As a child.

3.  Yes, I've tested this belief.

4.  Yes, I can test them now.

5.  By looking at stats on the racial and gender imbalances in tech
    and on educational spending per capita for various social groups.

6.  Yes, I'm willing to do that.
    (The world comes up short when I do...)

7.  This belief is what motivates participation in this group.
    (Participants may put a veneer of self-interest on that belief,
    e.g., say that they want to increase diversity in computing
    in order to have a larger pool of talent to hire from,
    but in my experience that's just rationalization:
    people who actually *do* something about tech's imbalances
    are always really motivated by principle.)

8.  Yes,
    I expect other participants in this group will share this belief.
