1. Abstraction and finding a core principle.

2. Blue-sky thinking and rapid, broad-stroke planning.

3. Yes, I'm good at thinking about details: I'm less good at acting on them.

9. Yes; but I doubt my intuition, usually.

10. Support an agreed plan; contribute verbally, but when agreed just do it.

2.  My default mode of operation is to work on my own,
    figuring out my next step as I go.

3.  I am detail-oriented when it comes to technical things like programming,
    but very much *not* detail-oriented when it comes to organizational things like budgets and schedules.

4.  Yes, I tend to see the big picture and miss the details.

5.  No, I am *not* good at planning.

6.  No, I do *not* think first and plan carefully.

7.  Yes, I tend to act first and plan later (if at all).

8.  No, I do not weigh decision carefully.

9.  Yes, I tend to be intuitive.

10. When I volunteer, I like to get started right away.
    (I also like to be in charge, but I'm working on that...)
