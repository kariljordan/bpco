## Christina

1. I am good at taking disparate elements or complicated ideas and making meaning out of them. 

2. My default mode of operation is: have ideas, talk to people about them, then go away and construct something on my own.

3. I am detail-oriented when sufficiently motivated about the big picture. 

4. I definitely want to see the big picture, but it takes me time to get there.  

5. I am good at planning (when I take the time to do it). 

6. I plan, but not carefully!  

7. Not so much.  I usually plan at least a little bit.  

8. I weigh decisions carefully; it takes me a long time to make big decisions.  

9. I used to not listen to my intuition at all, am now trying to listen more. 

10. Be helpful in the background, work on concrete tasks, do something that makes a difference.
