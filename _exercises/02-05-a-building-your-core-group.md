## Ian Hawke

I believe that...

1. Abstraction and finding a core principle.

2. Blue-sky thinking and rapid, broad-stroke planning.

3. Yes, I'm good at thinking about details: I'm less good at acting on them.

4. Tend to focus or care too narrowly to see the *whole* big picture.

5. I'm good at making partial plans; less good at carrying them through.

6. Yes; of course, planning carefully is not the same as planning well.

7. No; acting nearly always comes third or fourth on the list.

8. Yes; although things are often given time for the subconscious to sort out, rather than being "weighed".

9. Yes; but I doubt my intuition, usually.

10. Support an agreed plan; contribute verbally, but when agreed just do it.
