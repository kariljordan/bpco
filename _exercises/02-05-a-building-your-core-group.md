## Ian Hawke

I believe that...

1. Abstraction and finding a core principle.

2. Blue-sky thinking and rapid, broad-stroke planning.

3. Yes, I'm good at thinking about details: I'm less good at acting on them.

4. Tend to focus or care too narrowly to see the *whole* big picture.

5. I'm good at making partial plans; less good at carrying them through.

6. Yes; of course, planning carefully is not the same as planning well.

7. No; acting nearly always comes third or fourth on the list.

8. Yes; although things are often given time for the subconscious to sort out, rather than being "weighed".

9. Yes; but I doubt my intuition, usually.

10. Support an agreed plan; contribute verbally, but when agreed just do it.

## Christina Koch

1. I am good at taking disparate elements or complicated ideas, organizing them, and making meaning out of them. 

2. My default mode of operation is: have ideas, talk to people about them, then go away and construct something on my own.

3. I am detail-oriented when sufficiently motivated about the big picture. 

4. I definitely want to see the big picture, but it takes me time to get there.  

5. I am good at planning (when I take the time to do it). 

6. I plan, but not carefully!  

7. I usually plan at least a little bit.  That said, for certain things my plan is: 
	"Start working. See what happens. Organize that. Make a real plan." 

8. I weigh decisions carefully; it takes me a long time to make big decisions.  

9. I used to not listen to my intuition at all, am now trying to listen more. 

10. Be helpful in the background, work on concrete tasks, do something that makes a difference.  

## Greg Wilson

2.  My default mode of operation is to work on my own,
    figuring out my next step as I go.

3.  I am detail-oriented when it comes to technical things like programming,
    but very much *not* detail-oriented when it comes to organizational things like budgets and schedules.

4.  Yes, I tend to see the big picture and miss the details.

5.  No, I am *not* good at planning.

9.  Yes, I tend to be intuitive.

10. When I volunteer, I like to get started right away.
    (I also like to be in charge, but I'm working on that...)
