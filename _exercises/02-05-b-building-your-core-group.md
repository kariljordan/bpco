## Greg Wilson

1.  People who are more patient and thoughtful,
    who enjoy careful background research,
    and who care more about getting the right answer than getting a plausible answer quickly.

2.  I have no special knowledge when compared to other likely participants in this group.

3.  I lack contacts:
    I only know a handful of leaders of organizations of the kind I want to bring together,
    and only a couple of possible funders.

4.  The people I already know may be able to make introductions.

5.  The core group needs people who can organize an annual event
    and keep an online discussion lively.

6.  Given the central purpose of the organization,
    I believe many of the core participants will have these skills.
    (Many of them will be organizers themselves.)
